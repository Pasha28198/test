i use Redux.js for state app, react-router.js for routing app, react.js for reactive and fast app,
you can run this app with comand yarn install and yarn start.
For fast styling app i use react-semantic.ui

P.S: i think for more productive developing for this kind of app we can use mobX.js


i use cypress for n2n tests because i think it more prodactive then unit and another method testing for Front-end
if you want start tests you should start server yarn start and then you can start yarn test
